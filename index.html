							<h2>Week 1-3 </h2>
							<p>Units 1-3 introduced the essentials of research methods, with a focus on the scientific method and its relevance to computing. We explored the purposes of research, differentiating between deductive and inductive reasoning, and emphasised the importance of ethical considerations in ensuring the validity of findings and the responsible treatment of participants. This foundation is essential for rigorous and ethical research practices.
								These units provided a basis for how to develop a research proposal, starting with formulating clear and relevant research questions. This included learning how to conduct and critique literature reviews, which help us identify key theories, methods, and gaps in existing research. Understanding the structure of a strong research proposal has equipped me to present ideas coherently and critically evaluate sources.
								We also delved into research methodologies, exploring ontological, epistemological, and axiological perspectives that shape research and how the three paradigms can influence how a researcher approaches a topic (Al-Ababneh, 2020). We distinguished between exploratory and conclusive research designs and examined qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods. These units of the module allowed provided a solid understanding of how to choose the most appropriate approach for various research projects. These foundational skills are key to conducting effective research throughout my academic and professional journey.

							<h2>Week 4-6</h2>
							<p>  In unit 4 we explored various data collection methods, including case studies, focus groups, and observations, primarily used in qualitative research but also applicable to quantitative studies. We learned the advantages and limitations of each method, helping us select the most suitable approach for different research projects. Through practical application, we gained skills in conducting case studies, focus groups, and observations, learning to choose the right method for specific investigations and understanding the types of data each produces.
In Unit 5 specifically we focused on interviews, survey methods, and questionnaire design. We explored in-depth interviews as a key qualitative method and the significance of surveys for quantitative data collection. We also distinguished between surveys and questionnaires, examining how to design effective questionnaires for reliable data collection. Pre-testing and post-testing methods were also covered, giving us the tools to evaluate the impact of new systems or processes. 
By unit 6, I gained a solid understanding of quantitative methods, focusing on how they examine relationships between numerically measured variables. In this module we learned the importance of organising data into datasets and explored the concept of levels of measurement, which is crucial for selecting appropriate statistical techniques. Additionally, I now appreciate the value of descriptive statistics in summarizing data through measures of location (typical observation) and dispersion (spread). The introduction to graphical summaries enhanced my ability to visualize data, preparing me for deeper exploration of data visualization that may be useful for my reseach. Overall, this unit strengthened my foundational skills in quantitative analysis. By the end of these three units I learned to integrate interviews and surveys into research, design questionnaires, and effectively analyse collected data. This skills I think are necessary to enhance my ability to choose and implement the best data collection techniques based on the objective of my research.

							<h2>Week 7-9 </h2>
							<p>In Units 7 through 9, we expanded our understanding of quantitative methods, focusing on inferential statistics, hypothesis testing, and data visualisation. Unit 7 introduced inferential statistics, where we learned how to analyse a sample group to draw conclusions about a larger population. Through the lecture cast We practiced hypothesis testing, applying appropriate probability distributions to extract meaningful insights from data. These skills helped me grasp how to make informed inferences from limited data.

								In Unit 8, we shifted our attention to data analysis and visualisation, learning techniques for interpreting both qualitative and quantitative data. We explored the challenges of coding qualitative data for categorisation and the significance of data visualisation tools like charts, graphs, and dashboards in communicating findings effectively. This reinforced the importance of presenting data clearly and concisely in research and business settings.
								
								Unit 9 delved into the key concepts of validity, generalisability, and reliability in research. We examined how these factors influence data collection and analysis and discussed data cleansing and validation for both qualitative and quantitative datasets. By understanding these concepts, I now appreciate how essential it is to ensure that research findings are reliable and applicable to broader contexts.
								Although I found this a challenge, the statistical worksheet submissions further deepened my understanding of descriptive and inferential statistics, hypothesis testing, and data visualisation

							<h2>Week 10-12 </h2>
							<p>Reflecting on Units 10 through 12, I gained valuable insights into research writing, professional development, and project management. Unit 10 emphasised the importance of clear and structured research writing, which is crucial for effectively communicating technical knowledge. I learned how to prepare a research proposal, conduct a literature review, and select appropriate research methods. Creating my own research proposal on “the Gender Pay Gap in the Technology Sector An Intersectional Analysis of Gender and Race” further solidified these skills, especially in structuring and presenting complex ideas. In Unit 11, the focus on model selection and evaluation enhanced my understanding of choosing the right models for specific tasks. This structured approach was essential for reflecting on my strengths and identifying areas for improvement. Unit 12 introduced project management principles, particularly in managing risk and change within a project. I learned about project life cycles, the importance of metrics, and strategies for handling risk and uncertainty. These skills, along with an understanding of change control processes, are crucial for maintaining project timelines, budgets, and quality, particularly in data-driven projects.
